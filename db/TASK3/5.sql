/*5. Make an authorâ€™s competition cross-map. Create a statement that will 
generate random authors distribution by competition pairs. Statement will
generate a list of author names pairs selected for a single round of 
tournament, displayed as two separate columns. Each author must be
presented in result set (in both columns) once only (the total number of 
authors must be even). Do not use custom functions during current implementation.*/
